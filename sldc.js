const design = "This is where you would start working otu what kind of software you would want to use."
const implementation = "This is where you begin coding your program and impliment your plans"
const testingAndIntegration = "This is where the site is tested and the bugs and kinks are worked out. It is also where the website is released to be used by the public or whoever is using it."
const maintain = "Continues to update and fix problems that may arise as computer programs update and change."
